[general]

; The timezone you wish to use for logging, TTS services, and the web interface (if enabled)

; Enable the "repeat" functionality.
; Optionally you can disable the repeater thus not "repeating" the communications received.

; Courtesy tone
; To disable courtesy tones set to: false
; Otherwise use the filename of the courtesy tone, eg. BeeBoo (without the .wav extension)

; Enable automatic identificaiton?

; Ident interval (seconds) - 600 = 10 minutes!

; An optional delay before transmission (seconds) - default is "0" (no delay and therefore immediately repeat the transmission)
; Implemented as per user feature request here: https://github.com/allebb/pirrot/issues/21

; The PL/CTCSS to access the repeater
; Set to 'false' if you do not have a CTCSS/PL code to access the repeater.
; otherwise set the CTCSS/PL tone here eg. '110.9'

; Transmit operation mode
; 'vox' = Voice Operated Transmit
