You can use a text editor such as ``nano`` or ``vi`` to edit the file.

Once you have made changes to the configuration file you must however restart the Pirrot daemon for those changes to take affect, you can restart the daemon using this command:

```shell
sudo /etc/init.d/pirrot restart
```

# /etc/pirrot.conf
