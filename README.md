# Piplex - A Simplex Repeater controller for RaspberryPi

The Piplex project exists to offer a cheaper alternative to buying a dedicated simplex recording device.

Piplex also aims to provide additional functionality through the use of DTMF tones such as broadcast weather and time upon request.

## Requirements

The simplest hardware requirements are:

1. A Raspberry Pi 3
2. A radio (Baofeng used as per example)
3. A USB audio interface (EasyDigit as per example)

The radio should be setup to use VOX
